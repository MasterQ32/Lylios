# Lylios
A small pathtracer, nothing special really

Lylios was written in 2 days just for me to refresh my
skills in writing ray tracing renderers.
It does not feature a lot of stuff but the basics are implement:
- Flat Scene List
- Support for multiple types of geometry
- Diffuse and mirror reflections
